gvSIG Business Process Definition RELEASE NOTES
===============================================


|
|


Summary of use cases implemented after delivery of version 1.0 (build200906110445)
==================================================================================

- The application now automatically creates in the Plone Site an instance of ModelDDvlPloneTool,
  if one does not exist yet.
  
- Export an element as .zip archives with information in a character encoded (utf8) .xml file, 
  and plone binary content as separate files.

- Import into an element as .zip archives with .xml file and binary content.

- Cut/Copy/Paste/Delete on elements, or groups of elements.

- When pasting a Business Rule into a collection of Business Policies,
  refactor the Business Rule into a Business Policy,
  and vice-versa. Same for Reception/Input, Sends/Outputs,
  Tool/Artefact, Organizational Unit/Profile.
  
- Create a new Version as a copy of a whole root organization and its contents, 
  maintaining traceability links from elements in the new version 
  to elements in the previous version.  
  
- Standard Plone actions are intercepted or aliased to maintain a tight contron on application instances.
